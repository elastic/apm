### Spans

The agent should also have a sense of the most common libraries for these and instrument them without any further setup from the app developers.

#### Span stack traces

Spans may have an associated stack trace, in order to locate the associated source code that caused the span to occur. If there are many spans being collected this can cause a significant amount of overhead in the application, due to the capture, rendering, and transmission of potentially large stack traces. It is possible to limit the recording of span stack traces to only spans that are slower than a specified duration, using the config variable `ELASTIC_APM_SPAN_FRAMES_MIN_DURATION`.

#### Span count

When a span is started a counter should be incremented on its transaction, in order to later identify the _expected_ number of spans. In this way we can identify data loss, e.g. because events have been dropped, or because of instrumentation errors.

To handle edge cases where many spans are captured within a single transaction, the agent should enable the user to start dropping spans when the associated transaction exeeds a configurable number of spans. When a span is dropped, it is not reported to the APM Server, but instead another counter is incremented to track the number of spans dropped. In this case the above mentioned counter for started spans is not incremented.

```json
"span_count": {
  "started": 500,
  "dropped": 42
}
```

Here's how the limit can be configured for [Node.js](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/nodejs/current/agent-api.html#transaction-max-spans) and [Python](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/python/current/configuration.html#config-transaction-max-spans).
