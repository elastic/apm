### Tracer APIs

All agents must provide an API to enable developers to instrument their applications manually, in addition to any automatic instrumentation. Agents document their APIs in the elastic.co docs:

- [Node.js Agent](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/nodejs/current/api.html)
- [Go Agent](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/go/current/api.html)
- [Java Agent](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/java/current/public-api.html)
- [.NET Agent](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/dotnet/current/public-api.html)
- [Python Agent](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/python/current/api.html)
- [Ruby Agent](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/ruby/current/api.html)
- [RUM JS Agent](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/js-base/current/api.html)

In addition to each agent having a "native" API for instrumentation, they also implement the [OpenTracing APIs](https://opentracing.io). Agents should align implementations according to https://github.com/elastic/apm/issues/32.
