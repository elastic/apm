# AWS Lambda instrumentation
This spec specifies the instrumentation of applications / services running on AWS Lambda.

An AWS Lambda application needs to implement a **handler method** that is called whenever that Lambda function is invoked. A handler method receives (at least) two objects with useful information:
- `event`: Depending on the trigger type of the Lambda function this object contains different, trigger-specific data. For some trigger types this object may be empty/null.
- `context`: This object provides generic (trigger agnostic) meta information about the Lambda function.

In our instrumentation we use these objects to derive useful meta and context information.

## Generic Lambda Instrumentation
In general, to instrument Lambda functions, we create transactions that wrap the execution of that handler method. In cases where we cannot assume any type or information in the `event` object (e.g. if the trigger type is undefined), we ignore trigger-specific information and simply wrap the handler method with a transaction, while using the `context` object to derive some necessary fields:

Field | Value | Description | Source
---   | ---   | --- | ---
`name` | e.g. `MyFunctionName` | The transaction name. Use function name if trigger type is `other`. | `context.functionName`
`type` | e.g. `request`, `messaging` | The transaction type. | Use `request` if trigger type is undefined.
`outcome` | `success` / `failure` | Set to `failure` if there was a [function error](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-retries.html). | -
`result` | `success` / `failure` / `HTTP Xxx` | See API Gateway below. For other triggers, set to `failure` if there was a function error, otherwise `success`. | Trigger specific.
`faas.name` | e.g. `my-function` | The lambda function name. | Use the value of `context.functionName` or the `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME` environment variable.
`faas.version` | e.g. `123` | The lambda function version. | Use the value of `context.functionVersion` or the `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_VERSION` environment variable.
`faas.id` | e.g. `arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:my-function` | Use the ARN of the function **without the alias suffix**. | `context.invokedFunctionArn`, remove the 8th ARN segment if the ARN contains an alias suffix. `arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:my-function:someAlias` will become `arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:my-function`.
`faas.trigger.type` | `other` | The trigger type. Use `other` if trigger type is unknown / cannot be specified. | More concrete triggers are `http`, `pubsub`, `datasource`, `timer` (see specific triggers below).
`faas.execution` | `af9aa4-a6...` | The AWS request ID of the function invocation | `context.awsRequestId`
`faas.coldstart` | `true` / `false` | Boolean value indicating whether a Lambda function invocation was a cold start or not. | [see section below](deriving-cold-starts)
`faas.trigger.request_id` | - | Do not set this field if trigger type is `other`.  | Trigger specific.
`context.cloud.origin.provider` | `aws` | Constant value for the origin cloud provider. | -
`context.cloud.origin.*` | - | Do not set these fields if trigger type is `other`.  | Trigger specific.
`context.service.origin.*` | - | Do not set these fields if trigger type is `other`. | Trigger specific.

Note that `faas.*` fields *are not* nested under the context property [in the intake api](https://github.com/elastic/apm-server/blob/main/docs/spec/v2/transaction.json)! `faas` is a top-level key on the transaction.

### Overwriting Metadata
Automatically capturing cloud metadata doesn't work reliably from a Lambda environment. Moreover, retrieving cloud metadata through an additional HTTP request may slowdown the lambda function / increase cold start behaviour. Therefore, the generic cloud metadata fetching should be disabled when the agent is running in a lambda context (for instance through checking for the existence of the `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME` environment variable).
Where possible, metadata should be overwritten at Lambda runtime startup corresponding to the field specifications in this spec.

Some metadata fields are not available at startup (e.g. `invokedFunctionArn` which is needed for `cloud.account.id` and `faas.id`). Therefore, retrieval of metadata fields in a lambda context needs to be delayed until the first execution of the lambda function, so that information provided in the `context` object can used to set metadata fields properly.

The following metadata fields are relevant for lambda functions:

Field | Value | Description | Source
---   | ---   | --- | ---
`service.name`| e.g. `MyFunctionName` | If the service name is *explicitly* specified through the `service_name` agent config option, use the configured name. Otherwise, use the name of the Lambda function. | If the service name is not explicitly configured, use the Lambda function name: `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME` or `context.functionName`
`service.version` | e.g. `$LATEST` |  If the service version is *explicitly* specified through the `service_version` agent config option, use the configured version. Otherwise, use the lambda function version. | If the service version is not explicitly configured, use the Lambda function version: `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_VERSION` or `context.functionVersion`
`service.framework.name` | `AWS Lambda` | Constant value for the framework name. | -
`service.runtime.name`| e.g. `AWS_Lambda_java8` |Â The lambda runtime. | `AWS_EXECUTION_ENV`
`service.node.configured_name` | e.g. `2019/06/07/[$LATEST]e6f...` | The log stream name uniquely identifying a function instance. | `AWS_LAMBDA_LOG_STREAM_NAME` or `context.logStreamName`
`cloud.provider` | `aws` | Constant value for the cloud provider. | -
`cloud.region` | e.g. `us-east-1` | The cloud region. | `AWS_REGION`
`cloud.service.name` | `lambda` |  Constant value for the AWS service.
`cloud.account.id` | e.g. `123456789012` | The cloud account id of the lambda function. | 5th fragment in `context.invokedFunctionArn`.

### Deriving cold starts
A cold start occurs if AWS needs first to initialize the Lambda runtime (including the Lambda process, such as JVM, Node.js process, etc.) in order to handle a request. This happens for the first request and after long function idle times. A Lambda function instance only executes one event at a time (there is no concurrency). Thus, detecting a cold start is as simple as detecting whether the invocation of a __handler method__ is the **first since process startup** or not. This can be achieved with a global / process-scoped flag that is flipped at the first execution of the handler method.

### Disabled functionalities
The following agent functionalities need to be disabled when tracing AWS Lambda functions until decided otherwise:
- **Metrics collection:** this includes all kind of metrics: system, process and breakdown metrics and is equivalent to
setting `ELASTIC_APM_METRICS_INTERVAL = 0`
- **Remote configuration:** equivalent to setting `ELASTIC_APM_CENTRAL_CONFIG = false`
- **Cloud metadata discovery:** equivalent to setting `ELASTIC_APM_CLOUD_PROVIDER = none`
- **System metadata discovery:** in some agents, this may be a relatively heavy task. For example, the Java agent
executes extenal commands in order to discover the hostname, which is not required for AWS Lambda metadata. All other
agents read and parse files to extract container and k8s metadata, which is not required as well.

There are two main approaches for agents to disable the above functionalities:
* Agents that will be always deployed as part of an additional APM Agent Lambda layer (e.g. Java agent) may disable this
through configuration options (e.g. environment variables) built in the lambda wrapper script(`AWS_LAMBDA_EXEC_WRAPPER`)
that is provided with the APM Agent Lambda layer.
* Agents that will be used with AWS lambda without the need for an additional Lambda layer must detect that they are
running in an AWS Lambda environment (for instance through checking for the existence of the `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME`
environment variable). Such agents should disable the aforementioned functionalities programmatically to achieve the
same behaviour that would be achieved through the corresponding configuration options.

## Trigger-specific Instrumentation
Lambda functions can be triggered in many different ways. A generic transaction for a Lambda invocation can be created independently of the actual trigger. However, depending on the trigger type, different information might be available that can be used to capture additional transaction data or that allows additional, valuable spans to be derived. The most common triggers that we want dedicated instrumentation support for are the following:

- API Gateway V1
- API Gateway V2
- SQS
- SNS
- S3

If none of the above apply, the fallback should be a generic instrumentation (as described above) that can deal with any type of trigger (thus capturing only the minimal available information).

### API Gateway / Lambda URLS
There are two different API Gateway versions (V1 & V2) that differ slightly in the information (`event` object) that is passed to the Lambda handler function.

With both versions, the `event` object contains information about the http request.
Usually API Gateway-based Lambda functions return an object that contains the HTTP response information.
The agent should use the information in the request and response objects to fill the HTTP context (`context.request` and `context.response`) fields in the same way it is done for HTTP transactions.

In particular, agents must use the `event.headers` to retrieve the `traceparent` and the `tracestate` and use them to start the transaction for the lambda function execution.

In addition the following fields should be set for API Gateway-based Lambda functions:

Field | Value | Description | Source
---   | ---   | ---         | ---
`type` | `request`| Transaction type: constant value for API gateway. | -
`name` | e.g. `GET /prod/proxy/{proxy+}` | Transaction name: Http method followed by a whitespace and the (resource) path. See section below. | -
`transaction.result` | `HTTP Xxx` / `success` | `HTTP 5xx` if there was a function error (see [Lambda error handling doc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/services-apigateway.html#services-apigateway-errors). If the [invocation response has a "statusCode" field](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-develop-integrations-lambda.html#http-api-develop-integrations-lambda.response), then set to `HTTP Xxx` based on the status code, otherwise `success`. | Error or `response.statusCode`.
`faas.trigger.type` | `http` | Constant value for API gateway. | -
`faas.trigger.request_id` | e.g. `afa4-a6...` | ID of the API gateway request. | `event.requestContext.requestId`
`context.service.origin.name` | e.g. `gdnrpwmtsb...amazonaws.com` | The full domain name of the API Gateway. | `event.requestContext.domainName`
`context.service.origin.id` | e.g. `gy415nu...` | `event.requestContext.apiId` |
`context.service.origin.version` | e.g. `1.0` | `1.0` for API Gateway V1, `2.0` for API Gateway V2. | `event.version` (or `1.0` if that field is not present)
`context.cloud.origin.service.name` | `api gateway` or `lambda url` | Constant value. | Detect lambda URLs by searching for `.lambda-url.` in the `event.requestContext.domainName`. Otherwise assume API Gateway.
`context.cloud.origin.account.id` | e.g. `12345678912` | Account ID of the API gateway. | `event.requestContext.accountId`
`context.cloud.origin.provider` | `aws` | Use `aws` as constant value. | -

**Set `transaction.name` for the API Gateway trigger**

There are different ways to setup an API Gateway in AWS resulting in different payload format versions:
* ["HTTP" proxy integrations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-develop-integrations-lambda.html) can be configured to use payload format 1.0 or 2.0.
* The older ["REST" proxy integrations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/set-up-lambda-proxy-integrations.html#api-gateway-simple-proxy-for-lambda-input-format) use payload format version 1.0.

For both payload format versions (1.0 and 2.0), the general pattern is `$method $resourcePath` (unless the `use_path_as_transaction_name` agent config option is used). Some examples are:
* `GET /prod/some/resource/path` (specific resource path)
* `GET /prod/proxy/{proxy+}` (proxy in v1.0 with dynamic path)
* `POST /prod/$default` (proxy in v2.0 with dynamic path)

*Payload format version 1.0:*

For payload format version 1.0, use `${event.requestContext.httpMethod} /${event.requestContext.stage}${event.requestContext.resourcePath}`.

If `use_path_as_transaction_name` is applicable and set to `true`, use `${event.requestContext.httpMethod} ${event.requestContext.path}` as the transaction name.

*Payload format version 2.0:*

For [payload format version](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-develop-integrations-lambda.html) 2.0 (which can be identified as having `${event.requestContext.http}`), use `${event.requestContext.http.method} /${event.requestContext.stage}${_routeKey_}`.

In version 2.0, the `${event.requestContext.routeKey}` can have the format `GET /some/path`, `ANY /some/path` or `$default`. For the `_routeKey_` part, extract the path (after the space) in the `${event.requestContext.routeKey}` or use `/$default`, in case of `$default` value in `${event.requestContext.routeKey}`.

If `use_path_as_transaction_name` is applicable and set to `true`, use `${event.requestContext.http.method} ${event.requestContext.http.path}` as the transaction name.

### Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)

An Application Load Balancer (ALB) -- a type of ELB -- can be targeted directly
to lambda.

The agent should use the information in the request and response objects to
fill the HTTP context (`context.request` and `context.response`) fields in the
same way it is done for HTTP transactions.
[Request/Response Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/lambda-functions.html#receive-event-from-load-balancer)

In particular, agents must use the `event.headers` to retrieve the
`traceparent` and the `tracestate` and use them to start the transaction for
the lambda function execution.

In addition the following fields should be set for ELB-based Lambda functions:

Field | Value | Description | Source
---   | ---   | ---         | ---
`type` | `request`| Transaction type: constant value for ELB. | -
`name` | e.g. `GET unknown route` | `{event.httpMethod} unknown route` An ALB acts as a gateway for any URL path, so to avoid high cardinality issues, "unknown route" should be used as described in [the HTTP Transactions spec](./tracing-instrumentation-http.md). The `use_path_as_transaction_name` config option should be honored. If a web framework is used in the Lambda function, it may provide a route name. | -
`result` | `HTTP Xxx` / `success` | `HTTP 5xx` if there was a function error. If the [invocation response has a "statusCode" field](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/lambda-functions.html#respond-to-load-balancer) and it is an integer, then set to `HTTP Xxx` based on the status code, otherwise `HTTP 5xx`. ELB defaults to a "502 Bad Gateway" response if the function returns no or an invalid "statusCode" | Error or `response.statusCode`.
`outcome` | `success` / `failure` | Set to `failure` if there was a function error, the response object does not contain an integer "statusCode", or the "statusCode" is `>= 500`. | -
`faas.trigger.type` | `http` | Constant value for ELB. | -
`context.service.origin.name` | e.g. `targetgroup` | ELB target group | `event.requestContext.elb.targetGroupArn` is formed as `arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:region-code:account-id:targetgroup/target-group-name/target-group-id`, so use `targetGroupArn.split(':')[5].split('/')[1]` to get the `target-group-name`.
`context.service.origin.id` | e.g. `arn:aws:elasticlo...65c45c6791a` | ELB target group ARN | `event.requestContext.elb.targetGroupArn` |
`context.cloud.origin.service.name` | `elb` | Constant value for ELB. | -
`context.cloud.origin.account.id` | e.g. `123456789012` | Account ID for the ELB. | Derived from the 5th segment of `event.requestContext.elb.targetGroupArn`
`context.cloud.origin.region` | e.g. `us-east-2` | Cloud region. | Derived from the 4th segment of `event.requestContext.elb.targetGroupArn`
`context.cloud.origin.provider` | `aws` | Use `aws` as constant value. | -

Note that the `context.service.origin.version` is omitted for ELB requests.

An example ELB event:

```
{
    "requestContext": {
        "elb": {
            "targetGroupArn": "arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-east-2:123456789012:targetgroup/lambda-279XGJDqGZ5rsrHC2Fjr/49e9d65c45c6791a"
        }
    },
    "httpMethod": "POST",
    "path": "/toolz/api/v2.0/downloadPDF/PDF_2020-09-11_11-06-01.pdf",
    "queryStringParameters": {
        "test%40key": "test%40value",
        "language": "en-DE"
    },
    "headers": {
        "accept-encoding": "gzip,deflate",
        "connection": "Keep-Alive",
        "host": "blabla.com",
        "user-agent": "Apache-HttpClient/4.5.13 (Java/11.0.15)",
        "x-amzn-trace-id": "Root=1-5bdb40ca-556d8b0c50dc66f0511bf520",
        "x-forwarded-for": "199.99.99.999",
        "x-forwarded-port": "443",
        "x-forwarded-proto": "https"
    },
    "body": "blablablabody",
    "isBase64Encoded": false
}
```

### SQS / SNS

Lambda functions that are triggered by SQS (or SNS) accept an `event` input that may contain one or more SQS / SNS messages in the `event.records` array. All message-related context information (including the `traceparent`) is encoded in the individual message attributes (if at all).

#### SQS

Agents SHOULD check each record, [up to a maximum of 1000](tracing-instrumentation-messaging.md#receiving-trace-context),
for a `traceparent` message attribute, and create a [span link](span-links.md)
on the transaction for each message with trace-context.

In addition to [the generic Lambda transaction fields](#generic-lambda-instrumentation)
the following fields SHOULD be set. The use of `records[0]` below depends on the
understanding from [AWS Lambda SQS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-sqs.html)
that a trigger invocation can only include messages from *one* queue.

Field | Value | Description | Source
---   | ---   | ---         | ---
`type` | `messaging`| Transaction type: constant value for SQS. | -
`name` | e.g. `RECEIVE SomeQueue` | Transaction name: Follow the [messaging spec](./tracing-instrumentation-messaging.md) for transaction naming. | Simple queue name can be derived from the 6th segment of `records[0].eventSourceArn`.
`faas.trigger.type` | `pubsub` | Constant value for message based triggers | -
`context.service.origin.name` | e.g. `my-queue` | SQS queue name | Simple queue name can be derived from the 6th segment of `records[0].eventSourceArn`.
`context.service.origin.id` | e.g. `arn:aws:sqs:us-east-2:123456789012:my-queue` | SQS queue ARN. |Â `records[0].eventSourceArn`
`context.cloud.origin.service.name` | `sqs` | Constant value for SQS. | -
`context.cloud.origin.region` | e.g. `us-east-1` | SQS queue region. | `records[0].awsRegion`
`context.cloud.origin.account.id` | e.g. `12345678912` | Account ID of the SQS queue. | Parse account segment (5th) from `records[0].eventSourceArn`.
`context.cloud.origin.provider` | `aws` | Use `aws` as constant value. | -

An example SQS event:

```
{
  "Records": [
    {
      "messageId": "94f54f6b-0b5d-4071-b752-103f481796d9",
      "receiptHandle": "A...w==",
      "body": "this is my body",
      "attributes": {
        "ApproximateReceiveCount": "1",
        "SentTimestamp": "1646785527296",
        "SenderId": "A...W",
        "ApproximateFirstReceiveTimestamp": "1646785527302"
      },
      "messageAttributes": {
        "Greeting": {
          "binaryValue": "SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==",
          "stringListValues": [],
          "binaryListValues": [],
          "dataType": "Binary"
        },
        "Population": {
          "stringValue": "1250800",
          "stringListValues": [],
          "binaryListValues": [],
          "dataType": "Number"
        },
        "City": {
          "stringValue": "Any City",
          "stringListValues": [],
          "binaryListValues": [],
          "dataType": "String"
        }
      },
      "md5OfBody": "567762fc32b60cd7fc4abbe9cf1fcfbe",
      "md5OfMessageAttributes": "28eb0e573cf8e8a77e349a2f968eac4a",
      "eventSource": "aws:sqs",
      "eventSourceARN": "arn:aws:sqs:us-west-2:627286350134:my-queue",
      "awsRegion": "us-west-2"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### SNS

Agents SHOULD check each record, [up to a maximum of 1000](tracing-instrumentation-messaging.md#receiving-trace-context),
for a `traceparent` message attribute (`Records.*.Sns.MessageAttributes`), and
create a [span link](span-links.md) on the transaction for each message with
trace-context.

In addition to [the generic Lambda transaction fields](#generic-lambda-instrumentation)
the following fields should be set. The use of `records[0]` is based on the
understanding, from ["all notification messages will contain a single published
message"](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/faqs/#Reliability), that an SNS trigger
will only ever have a single record.

Field | Value | Description | Source
---   | ---   | ---         | ---
`type` | `messaging`| Transaction type: constant value for SNS. | -
`name` | e.g. `RECEIVE SomeTopic` | Transaction name: Follow the [messaging spec](./tracing-instrumentation-messaging.md) for transaction naming. | Simple topic name can be derived from the 6th segment of `records[0].sns.topicArn`.
`faas.trigger.type` | `pubsub` | Constant value for message based triggers | -
`context.service.origin.name` | e.g. `my-topic` | SNS topic name | Simple topic name can be derived from the 6th segment of `records[0].sns.topicArn`.
`context.service.origin.id` | e.g. `arn:aws:sns:us-east-2:123456789012:my-topic` | SNS topic ARN. |Â `records[0].sns.topicArn`
`context.cloud.origin.service.name` | `sns` | Constant value for SNS. | -
`context.cloud.origin.region` | e.g. `us-east-1` | SNS topic region. | Parse region segment (4th) from `records[0].sns.topicArn`.
`context.cloud.origin.account.id` | e.g. `12345678912` | Account ID of the SNS topic. | Parse account segment (5th) from `records[0].sns.topicArn`.
`context.cloud.origin.provider` | `aws` | Use `aws` as constant value. | -

An example SNS event:

```
{
  "Records": [
    {
      "EventSource": "aws:sns",
      "EventVersion": "1.0",
      "EventSubscriptionArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:my-topic1:761195b9-8bb2-4dc7-bab2-8fb74214bb8b",
      "Sns": {
        "Type": "Notification",
        "MessageId": "d68d14fb-1178-51b7-99ae-4e5ae7c39b7f",
        "TopicArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:my-topic",
        "Subject": "this is my subject",
        "Message": "this is my message",
        "Timestamp": "2022-03-09T00:27:39.304Z",
        "SignatureVersion": "1",
        "Signature": "W...Q==",
        "SigningCertUrl": "https://sns.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/SimpleNotificationService-7ff5318490ec183fbaddaa2a969abfda.pem",
        "UnsubscribeUrl": "https://sns.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/?Action=Unsubscribe&...",
        "MessageAttributes": {
          "Greeting": {
            "Type": "Binary",
            "Value": "SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ=="
          },
          "Population": {
            "Type": "String",
            "Value": "1250800"
          },
          "City": {
            "Type": "String",
            "Value": "Any City"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### S3
Lambda functions that are triggered by S3 accept an `event` input that may contain one ore more `S3 event notification records` in the `event.records` array. We cannot (automatically) wrap the processing of the individual records that are sent as a batch of S3 event notification records with a single `event`.

Thus, in case that an S3 `event` contains **exactly one** `S3 event notification record`, the agents must apply the following, S3-specific retrieval of information. Otherwise, the agents should apply the [Generic Lambda Instrumentation](generic-lambda-instrumentation) as desribed above.

In addition the following fields should be set for Lambda functions triggered by S3:

Field | Value | Description | Source
---   | ---   | ---         | ---
`type` | `request`| Transaction type: constant value for S3. | -
`name` | e.g. `ObjectCreated:Put mybucket` | Transaction name: Use event name and bucket name. | `${record.eventName} ${record.s3.bucket.name}`
`faas.trigger.type` | `datasource` | Constant value. | -
`faas.trigger.reuqest_id` | e.g. `C3D13FE58DE4C810`| S3 event request ID. | `record.responseElements.xAmzRequestId`
`context.service.origin.name` | e.g. `mybucket` | S3 bucket name. | `record.s3.bucket.name`
`context.service.origin.id` | e.g. `arn:aws:s3:::mybucket` | S3 bucket ARN. |Â `record.s3.bucket.arn`

## Data Flushing
Lambda functions are immediately frozen as soon as the handler method ends.
Because APM data is sent in an asynchronous way, data can get lost if not sent
before the lambda function ends.

Therefore, the agents MUST ensure that data is flushed synchronously before the
execution of the handler function ends.

Instrumented lambda functions should use the custom-built [Lambda extension][1]
that allows the agent to send its data to `localhost`. The extension
asynchronously forwards the data it receives from the agent to the APM server
so the Lambda function can return its result with minimal delay. In order for
the extension to know when it can flush its data, it must receive a signal
indicating that the lambda function has completed. There are two possible
signals: one is via a subscription to the AWS Lambda Logs API and the other is
an agent intake request with the query param `flushed=true`. A signal from the
agent is preferable because there is an inherent delay with the sending of the
Logs API signal.  Therefore, the agent must send its final intake request at
the end of the function invocation with the query param `flushed=true`. In case
there is no more data to send at the end of the function invocation, the agent
must send an empty intake request with this query param.

If the `ELASTIC_APM_LAMBDA_APM_SERVER` environment variable is defined,
instrumented lambda functions should register a "partial transaction" with the
lambda extension as soon as the transaction is started.  This allows the lambda
extension to create and send a proxy transaction document even if the lambda
function times out and is unable to send the transaction document itself. The
process is as follows:

At the start of the transaction, the agent will encode and immediately send the
newly-created transaction to the extension at the `/register/transaction`
endpoint via a `POST` request. The first line of the ndjson payload should be
the metadata. The second line should be the transaction json blob. The request
MUST have the header `x-elastic-aws-request-id` (the lambda invocation's
request ID) and the Content-Type MUST be
`application/vnd.elastic.apm.transaction+ndjson`.  If the extension returns
anything other than a 200 HTTP code, the agent MUST stop sending partial
transaction registrations for future invocations.
